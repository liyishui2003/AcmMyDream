## 跌倒又爬起，山岭静悄悄
I enjoy thinking about algorithmic problems and have participated in several ACM competitions, achieving some modest results. Algorithmic contests are a lifelong passion for me, and I’ll never "retire" from them.

## My modest results

#### 2023 ICPC Collegiate Programming Contest Asia Regional Contest(Hangzhou) - Bronze Medal
